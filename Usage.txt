    The "student_attendance.txt" file will automatically be generated as an Excel file Format.
    The pandas library simplifies this task, being the most common for data manipulation 
    in Python.
    Install the libraries in the Linux terminal: pip install pandas openpyxl
    (It's important to also install openpyxl, as it's used internally by pandas to save 
    .xlsx files.)


Each record is saved in the following format:

Header: Student Course  Date       Time      Status
Record: [Name] [Course] DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM [Present/Absent]
